# Risk Claim Checklist

## High-Risk Claim Types
- Absolute outcomes ("100% cure", "never breaks")
- Unsupported medical/health claims
- Certification claims without document proof
- Competitive defamation claims
- Unrealistic logistics promises

## Rewrite Patterns
- Replace absolute with conditional probability language.
- Add conditions and usage boundaries.
- Convert hard guarantees to evidence-backed descriptions.

## Pre-Publish Checklist
- Are all numbers traceable to source?
- Are all certifications documented?
- Are superlatives necessary and supportable?
- Are translations preserving legal meaning?
